# CryptoDemonstrations
A python demonstration project for the basic cryptography concepts.<br>
For now it has only the client and middleman scripts. Clients communicate
with each other through the server called middleman.py.
Sockets are used for the communication between scripts. 
I will be adding basic cryptography schemes to the clients. 
You can run the project with the main.py, which will open 3 terminals.
You can see the communication between Alice and Bob on the middleman terminal.
<br>
Run on terminal:<ul><li> <code>cd {path\to\project}</code></li>
                    <li><code>py main.py </code></li>
