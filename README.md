# CryptoDemonstrations
A python demonstration project for the basic cryptography concepts.<br>
For now it has only the client and middleman scripts. Clients communicate
with each other through the server called middleman.py.
Sockets are used for the communication between scripts. 
I will be adding basic cryptography schemes to the clients. 
You can run the project with the main.py, which will open 3 terminals.
You can see the communication between Alice and Bob on the middleman terminal.
<br>
Run on terminal:<ul><li> <code>cd {path\to\project}</code></li>
                    <li><code>py main.py </code></li>
<h3>Disclaimer: </h3> 
This project is only meant to demonstrate how Cryptography schemes work and to help you understand these schemes.
It shouldn't be used in a professional setting as most of the schemes in the project are not cryptographically secure.
